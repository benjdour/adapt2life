## Purpose of Women's Health API

The Garmin Connect Women's Health API lets you access information
related to menstrual cycle tracking and schedule information. Similar to
the Health API, these metrics are also applicable to the wellness
population but additionally may be utilized alongside training plans and
workout schedules. After user consent, you can access the data logged by
end-users.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Endpoint Configuration

Women's Health API is server-to-server communication only. We deliver
event-driven notifications to your configured endpoints. Both the Push
Service and the Ping Service can be configured using the Endpoint
Configuration Tool found at <https://apis.garmin.com/tools/endpoints>.
